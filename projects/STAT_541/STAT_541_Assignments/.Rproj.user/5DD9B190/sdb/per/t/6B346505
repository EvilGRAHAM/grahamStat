While its difference in probability of death is smaller than heart disease, the likelihood and odds are both much greater than their heart disease counterparts.\n\n\n## 2.23\nLet $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n$$\n  H_{0}: \\text{Highest Degree and Religious Beliefs are independent}\n$$\n$$\n  H_{1}: \\text{Highest Degree and Religious Beliefs are dependent}\n$$\n\nP-Value:\n```{r 2.23 1}\nedu_rel_tbl <- matrix(c(178, 570, 138, 138, 648, 252, 108, 442, 252), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\ncolnames(edu_rel_tbl) <- c(\"Fundamentalist\", \"Moderate\", \"Liberal\")\nrownames(edu_rel_tbl) <- c(\"< High School\", \"High School or Junior College\", \"Bachelor or Graduate\")\nchisq.test(edu_rel_tbl, correct = FALSE)\n```\n\nBecause our p-value is $<\\alpha$, we reject our null hypothesis of independence, and assume some sort of dependency based on our sample.\n\n```{r 2.23 2}\nchisq.test(edu_rel_tbl, correct = FALSE)$stdres\n```\n\nThe large standarized residuals for the Fundamentalist and Liberal categories shows that their may exist some relation between education and those categories, hence their may be dependency.\n\n\n## 2.27\n### a.\nLet $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n$$\n  H_{0}: \\text{Family Income and Aspirations are independent}\n$$\n$$\n  H_{1}: \\text{Family Income and Aspirations are dependent}\n$$\n```{r 2.27a}\naspirations_tbl <- matrix(c(9, 44, 13, 10, 11, 52, 23, 22, 9, 41, 12, 27), nrow = 4, ncol = 3)\ncolnames(aspirations_tbl) <- c(\"L\", \"M\", \"H\")\nrownames(aspirations_tbl) <- c(\"Some HS\", \"Graduate HS\", \"Some College\", \"Graduate College\")\naspirations_tbl\nchisq.test(aspirations_tbl, correct = FALSE)\nchisq.test(aspirations_tbl, correct = FALSE)$expected\n```\nAt that level, we fail to reject our null hypothesis of independence, based on our sample. However, the family income levels are ordinal instead of purely categorical, our tests may not be accurate.\n\n### b.\n```{r 2.27b}\nchisq.test(aspirations_tbl, correct = FALSE)$stdres\n```\nFor low income families, we see a fair bit less number of students who aspire to graduate from college than what we would expect if they were independent. The opposite is true for high income families, where a fair bit more number of students expect to graduate from college, than we'd expect under the null hypothesis. For medium income families, our standardized residuals are all fairly small, so there may not be dependency. Note that all our standardized residuals are between $[-2.5, 2.5]$, so most likely no strong dependencies exists based on this sample.\n\n### c.\n```{r 2.27c}\nlibrary(coin)\naspirations_tbl <- as.table(aspirations_tbl)\nlbl_test(aspirations_tbl)\npchisq(statistic(lbl_test(aspirations_tbl))^2, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\n\nSince our p-value is $<\\alpha$, we reject our null hypothesis, and assume some dependency based on the sample.",
