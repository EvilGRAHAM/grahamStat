The response variable is Attitude towards gun control (favour, oppose).\n\n### b.\nThe explanatory variables are Blood pressure, and Cholesterol level. The response variable is Heart Disease (yes, no).\n\n### c.\nThe explanatory variables are Race (white, nonwhite), Religion (Catholic, Jewish, Protestant), and Annual income. The response variable is Vote for president (Democrat, Republican, Other).\n\n### d.\nThe explanatory variable is Marital status (married, single, divorced, widowed). The response variable is Quality of life (excellent, good, fair, poor).\n\n\n## 1.03\n\n### a.\nLet $X=$ the number of correct answers by the student on the exam. Let $p=\\frac{1}{4}$ be the probability of guessing the correct answer for a given question. Let $n=100$ be the number of questions on the exam. Then:\n$$\n  X \\sim Binom\\left( n = 100, p = \\frac{1}{4} \\right)\n$$\n\n### b.\nAssuming a Type I error rate of $5\\%$:\n$$\n  H_{0}: p = 0.25\n$$\n$$\n  H_{1}: p > 0.25\n$$\n$$\n  \\Prob \\left( X \\geq 50 \\right) =\n  \\sum_{x=50}^{100} {{100}\\choose{x}} 0.25^{x} (1-0.25)^{100-x}\n$$\nor equivalently in R:\n```{r 1.3b}\n  pbinom(50 - 1, 100, 0.25, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\nwhich is $<5\\%$. As such we reject the null hypothesis that the student was merely guessing for each question, and assume that their probability of getting the correct answer is $>0.25$ based on the sample.\n\n\n## 1.05\nWe need to find $\\phat$ s.t. we maximize $\\Prob\\left(Y = 0 \\middle| n = 2 \\right)$ subject to $p\\in[0,1]$\n$$\n  \\Prob\\left(Y = 0 \\middle| n = 2 \\right) =\n  {{2}\\choose{0}} p^{0} (1-p)^{2-0} =\n  (1-p)^{2} \\implies\n$$\n$$\n  \\frac{d}{dp} (1-p)^{2} =\n  -2(1-p) \\implies\n  0 = \n  -2(1-p) \\implies\n  p = 1\n$$\n$p=0$ is also an endpoint, so we can check that as well. For $p=1$, we have a likelihood of 0, and for $p=0$, we have a likelihood of 1.\n```{r 1.5}\n# p = 0\ndbinom(x = 0, size = 2, prob = 0)\n# p = 1\ndbinom(x = 0, size = 2, prob = 1)\n```\nSince our function is monotonic over this domain, $p = 0$ is our MLE.\n\nThis may not be reasonable however, as this would require the coin to have both sides as tails. As well, we have a small sample size of $n=2$, which makes it hard to draw a reasonable conclusion. If we use the bayesian estimator as given in the text, $p=\\frac{1}{4}$, which may be a more reasonable estimator for $p$ based on our limited data.\n\n\n## 1.07\n\n### a.\nLet $X$ be the bullet firing (a somewhat morbid success...), $n=6$, $p=\\frac{1}{6}$:\n$$\n  \\Prob \\left( X = 0 \\middle| n = 6, p = \\frac{1}{6} \\right) =\n  {{6}\\choose{0}} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{6-0} =\n  \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^{6} =\n  0.3349\n$$\n\n### b.\nWe have the case where we have $y-1$ number of non-fires, and then 1 fire. Since the order of the non-fires doesn't matter, we don't need a binomial term in our equation, as it would = 1. As well, each spin is independent, which allows us to multiply our probabilities together.\n$$\n  \\Prob \\left( X = 0 \\middle| n = y - 1 \\right) \\times \\Prob \\left( X = 1 \\middle| n = 1 \\right) =\n  (1-p)^{y-1}p \\stackrel{{p=\\frac{1}{6}}}{=}\n  \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^{y-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)\n$$\n\n\n## 1.11\n\n$$\n  \\phat = 0.86, n=1158\n$$\n$$\n  \\se \\left( \\phat \\right) = \n  \\sqrt{\\frac{0.86(1-0.86)}{1158}} =\n  0.0102\n$$\n95% CI for $p$:\n$$\n  0.86 \\mp 1.96(0.0102) =\n  [0.84, 0.88]\n$$\n\nThat is, we can say with 95% confidence the true proportion of american adults that believe in heaven is somewhere between 84% and 88% based on our sample.\n\n\n## 1.13\n\n### a.\n$$\n  \\ell = \n  \\prod_{i=1}^{25} \\Prob \\left( Y_{i} = 0 \\right) =\n  \\prod_{i=1}^{25} {{25}\\choose{0}} p^{y_{i}} (1-p)^{25-y_{i}} =\n$$\nNote: We can ignore the binomial term at the start, as it doesn't contain $p$.\n$$\n  \\ell =\n  p^{\\sum_{i=1}^{25} y_{i}} (1-p)^{25-\\sum_{i=1}^{25} y_{i}}\n$$\nSince $y_{i}=0,\\forall 1=1,2,\\dots,25$:\n$$\n  \\ell = (1-p)^{25}\n$$\n\nUnder $H_{0}$, we assume $p=0.5$, our likelihood function ($\\ell_{0}$) is maximized at $p=0.5$.\n$$\n  \\implies \\ell_{0} = (0.5)^{25}\n$$\n\n### b.\n$$\n  \\ell_{1} = (1-p)^{25} \\implies\n  \\frac{d}{dp}(1-p)^{25} = -25(1-p)^{24} \\implies\n  0 = -25(1-p)^{24} \\implies\n  p = 1\n$$\nWe also get $p=0$ due to it being our other endpoint in the domain $p\\in[0,1]$.\n$$\n  \\ell_{1}(0) = \n  (1-0)^{25} = \n  1\n$$\n$$\n  \\ell_{1}(1) = \n  (1-1)^{25} = \n  0\n$$\n\nSo our MLE is 0, with a likelihood of 1.\n\n### c.\n$$\n  {\\chi^{2}}_{calc} =\n  -2\\ln \\left( \\frac{(1-0.5)^{25}}{(1-0)^{25}} \\right) =\n  -2 \\ln \\left( 0.5^{25} \\right) =\n  34.65736 \\approx\n  34.7\n$$\n```{r 1.13c}\n  pchisq(q = -2*log(0.5^25), df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\n\nSo we have a p-value of $3.93 \\times 10^{-9}$, and can then reject our null hypothesis at that level.\n\n### d.\n$$\n  {\\chi^{2}}_{calc} =\n  -2\\ln \\left( \\frac{(1-0.074)^{25}}{(1-0)^{25}} \\right) =\n  3.844052 \\approx\n  3.84\n$$\n```{r 1.13d}\n  pchisq(q = -2*log((1-0.074)^25), df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\nSo our p-value is $\\approx 0.05$ meaning it is the upper bound for the 95% likelihood-ratio confidence interval.",
