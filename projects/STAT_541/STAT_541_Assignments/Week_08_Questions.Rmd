### Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test
$$
  H_{0}:\text{ Intercourse is independent of Gender, conditional on Race}
$$
  $$
  H_{1}:\text{ Intercourse is dependent on Gender, conditional on Race}
$$
  ```{r 4.29 CMH}
sex_cmh <- mantelhaen.test(sex_ct, correct = FALSE)
sex_cmh
```
With a p-value of `r round(sex_cmh$p.value, 4)`, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative based on the sample.

$$
  H_{0}:\text{ Intercourse is independent of Race, conditional on Gender}
$$
  $$
  H_{1}:\text{ Intercourse is dependent on Race, conditional on Gender}
$$
  ```{r 4.29 CMH Flip}
sex_cmh_flip <- mantelhaen.test(sex_ct_flip, correct = FALSE)
sex_cmh_flip
```
With a p-value of `r round(sex_cmh_flip$p.value, 4)`, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative based on the sample.

### Logistic Regression
```{r 4.29 Logit}
logit_sex_01 <- 
  sex_data %>% 
  glm(
    Intercourse ~ Race + Gender + Race:Gender
    ,family = binomial
    ,data = .
  )
summary(logit_sex_01)

logit_sex_02 <-
  sex_data %>% 
  glm(
    Intercourse ~ Race + Gender
    ,family = binomial
    ,data = .
  )
summary(logit_sex_02)

anova(logit_sex_02, logit_sex_01, test = "Chisq")
```
By doing a Likelihood Ratio Test between the model with an interaction term, and the model without, a p-value of `r round(anova(logit_sex_02, logit_sex_01, test = "Chisq")$"Pr(>Chi)"[2], 4)` is found. This fails to reject the null hypothesis of explaining equal amounts of variance, based on the sample. As such we can use the more parsimonious model.

Both the slope parameters are significant at $\alpha=0.05$, based on the sample. A White person on average has an increased log likelihood in favour of having intercourse of `r round(coefficients(logit_sex_02)[2], 4)` vs. a Black person, based on the sample. A Male on average has an increased log likelihood in favour of having intercourse of `r round(coefficients(logit_sex_02)[3], 4)` vs. a Female, based on the sample.

### a.
```{r 5.17a}
logit_death <- 
  death_data %>% 
  glm(
    Death ~ Victim + Defendant
    ,family = binomial
    ,data = .
  )
summary(logit_death)

death_summary %<>% 
  cbind(
    phat = 
      predict(

death_chisq_gof

death_gsq_gof <- flatr::goodness_of_fit(model = logit_death, type = "Gsq")
death_gsq_gof
```
Based on the sample, and the logistic regression found above, doing a $\chi^{2}$ Goodness of Fit Test yields a p-value of `r round(death_chisq_gof$p.value, 4)`. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the model fits the data and assume it to be true. A $G^{2}$ Goodness of Fit Test can't be used as no White Defendants with Black Victims were given the death penalty.

### c.
Both the slope parameters are significant at $\alpha=0.05$, based on the sample. A Defendant with a White Victim on average has an increased log likelihood in favour of getting the death penalty of `r round(coefficients(logit_death)[2], 4)` vs. a Black Victim, based on the sample. A White Defendant on average has an increased log likelihood in favour of getting the death penalty of `r round(coefficients(logit_death)[3], 4)` vs. a Black Defendant, based on the sample.

```
Based on the sample, and the logistic regression found above, doing a $\chi^{2}$ Goodness of Fit Test yields a p-value of `r round(lung_chisq_gof$p.value, 4)`. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the model fits the data and assume it to be true.
