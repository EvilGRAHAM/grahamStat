						Hi, welcome to my site! With any luck this website should link to some of the projects I've completed. Fingers crossed that this appears in the form of a card...

						This site currently is host to a R Studio Server, as well as a Shiny Server. The goal is to be able to host shiny applications and R Markdown docs for the different projects I'm working on or have completed. As well this is my first time at doing web development, so we'll see how well that goes...

						I'm currently a 5th year undergraduate at the University of Calgary in Finance and Statistics. I'm on track to graduate in the Winter 2018 semester with a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Science.

							Programming:
						</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
						I do most of my work in R, with an emphasis on the <a href="http://tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> packages. As well I've played around with <a href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a> and <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>. Additionally I'm familiar with T-SQL, having built a data warehouse of sorts with it from scratch in Microsoft Azure, Python 3, some VBA, and I'm learning HTML as I build this site. I don't know if you can really call Latex a language, but I've used that as well for school.

						</h2>

					<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
						This site is currently supported through the use of a "droplet" from Digital Ocean. They're super cheap and easy to run, so I'd highly recommend them if you need a low cost backend. If you use this link, we both get credits, so you should do that!
