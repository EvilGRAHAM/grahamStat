	I'm personally a fan of the moral philosophy of Deontology, or as it is better known; Kantianism. Kantian ethics is founded on the
	idea that it is the intent of an action that is important, not the consequence of said action. This leads to the idea of the 
	maxim which states: "In <i>x</i>, I will do <i>y</i>, in order to achieve <i>z</i>." That is, for a given situation <i>x</i>, I will do
	the action <i>y</i>, with the intention of achieving <i>z</i>. Kant states the categorical imperative, the central tenant of this philosophy as,
	"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law" (Kant, 1785). From this Kant created
	3 formulations that a maxim must pass in order to be moral.

<ol>
	<li>Formula of Universality and the Law of Nature</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Take your maxim and apply it to the world so that is functions as a universal law.
		</li>
		<li>
			Everybody when they are in those circumstances does your maxim, and see what happens.
		</li>
		<li>
			We are not checking the consequences of the universal law, but are checking the fundamental consistency of the maxim.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ways to fail:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Contradiction in Conception: We can't image said world, or would never want to live in it.
					This generates perfect duties, stating we can never do that maxim.
				</li>
				<li>
					Contradiction in the Will: We wished ourselves into said world, but our will causes a contradiction.
					We end up finding ourselves wishing that others wouldn't abide by the maxim. 
					This generates imperfect duties, stating we donâ€™t always fail/refuse to do that maxim.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Lies are something that always fail this formulation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The Formula of Humanity</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			All actions you take have to respect humanity as an end themselves, and not a means
		</li>
		<li>
			This formulation is built on the idea of consent. If you have consent/permission to use someone as a means,
			you may do so.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The Formula of Autonomy</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I find this best expressed using the example of the "Kingdom of Ends"
			<ul>
				<li>
					Always act such that your maxim acts as if you were legislating a kingdom of ends. 
					This kingdom is bound by a pre-agreed set of laws.
				</li>
				<li>
					Original Position: We are all rational beings, but we are behind a veil of ignorance,
					where we have no idea about who we are, or what we look like. We only now we are rational
				</li>
				<li>
					If said kingdom of ends is acceptable for everyone, the maxim passes this formulation.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul
