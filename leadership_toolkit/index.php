						Scarcity
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
					<p>
						The idea of scarcity, and how it can override one's decision making processes represents a strong tool for any leader. 
						Scarcity can work in a leader’s favour in one of two possible ways. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The first way is by removing scarcity, leaders can remove conflict. Because we value things that are scarce, 
						conflict can arise from this, when multiple people value something. By removing the scarcity around this thing, 
						by allowing people to share it, or creating more of it, conflict can be more easily resolved. Job rotations of preferable work or shifts, 
						creating an open office environment with no offices both rely on this idea, that by removing scarcity in the workplace, 
						leaders can help reduce conflict among followers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second means of using scarcity is by creating it. This increase value in people’s eyes, 
						as we recognize that we might not be able not be able to necessarily attain it. This can then be used to direct follower’s 
						efforts into tasks leaders deem more important. Things such as employee of the month programs, corner offices, promotions and 
						raises all work on this idea. These ideas may be artificially scarce (you could have more than one employee of the month, 
						or give smaller raises out to more people), or physically scarce (most offices only have as many corner offices as they have corners), 
						but the principle still holds.

						Reciprocation
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
					<p>
						Reciprocation is a tool that should be in any leader’s toolkit. It serves as a powerful means of directing followers towards a cause 
						and improving how one appears to those around them. While this tool requires some effort on the part of the leader, it is also one of 
						the more powerful tools leaders have at their disposal. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It is important to recognize that reciprocation can be used both ethically or unethically. When used to take advantage of followers, 
						by doing small favours in exchange for much larger ones, or by creating a false sense of obligation, leaders can get what they want out of followers.
						However, these leaders lose out on the opportunity to be able to build mutually beneficial, long term partnerships with their followers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead, ethical leaders should ensure that followers are an end to themselves, and not merely a means (see Deontology below). 
						By abstaining from the activities described previously, leaders can start to build effect, and mutually beneficial long-term partnerships, 
						allowing both the leader and the follower to grow and benefit. Through this, leaders and followers can move towards a common goal, 
						with both parties feeling that they had benefited from this endeavor.

						Trust
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
					<p>
						Trust is something that is seriously lacking from todays workplace. Without it, followers waste their time politicking, 
						and struggle to work together to achieve a common goal. If followers can’t trust their leaders, it becomes increasingly difficult to gain compliance, 
						and provide directions and feedback, as the followers become increasingly worried about their own wellbeing within the group. 
						This isn’t to say we should be entirely trusting of others, as this is a recipe to be taken advantage of, but we shouldn’t disregard it entirely.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are plenty of stories in the media of leaders bring in their mentors to help, only to get screwed over by said mentor, 
						and kicked to the curb. This story is all to common in Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs was pushed out in in 1985, a man who in 1976 had underreported 
						the value of a contract he had made with Atari to his business partner Steve Wozniak (Weinberger, 2017) (Warman, 2011). Elon Musk was ousted from PayPal in 2002, 
						and then ousted Martin Eberhard in 2007 from Tesla, the company he founded (Klebnikov, 2017) (Baer, 2014). This provides strong evidence to why we should remain skeptical, 
						even to those we trust, however to create strong, functional groups, a culture of distrust may backfire. My favourite example of this comes from "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" 
						Season 5, Episode 2, when Will Smith is fired as the manager of his cousin Ashley, after discovering her.

					<p>
						In the 1950’s, scientists at the RAND corporation conceived the idea of the prisoner’s dilemma, which was formulized by Princeton mathematician Albert Tucker 
						(Dixit, n.d.). The idea is that two players who play by their own utility maximizing strategy can result in an outcome than makes them both worse off than if 
						they had initially cooperated. This holds true with groups, where if members spend time disagreeing, and playing politics, instead of working towards their goal, 
						this may be beneficial if for a member if all other members abstain from this but makes the group worse off due to wasted time. Instead by encouraging all members 
						to work together, and be transparent in their actions, time can be better spent towards achieving the common goal.
					</p>
					<p>
						Leaders should encourage transparency within the group, as this is an effective means of building trust among members. By being transparent, 
						members are given little reason to squabble and waste valuable resources to move up the hierarchy that governs the group, but instead use them towards achieving a common goal. 
						By expanding a leader’s inner circle to include as many members as possible, trust is encouraged, as this removes the perception of preferential treatment.

						Deontology
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
					<p>
						I'm personally a fan of the moral philosophy of Deontology, or as it is better known; Kantianism. Kantian ethics is founded on the
						idea that it is the intent of an action that is important, not the consequence of said action. This leads to the idea of the 
						maxim which states: "In <i>x</i>, I will do <i>y</i>, in order to achieve <i>z</i>." That is, for a given situation <i>x</i>, I will do
						the action <i>y</i>, with the intention of achieving <i>z</i>. Kant states the categorical imperative, the central tenant of this philosophy as,
						"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law" (Kant, 1785). From this Kant created
						3 formulations that a maxim must pass in order to be moral.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Formula of Universality and the Law of Nature</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Take your maxim and apply it to the world so that is functions as a universal law.
							</li>
							<li>
								Everybody when they are in those circumstances does your maxim, and see what happens.
							</li>
							<li>
								We are not checking the consequences of the universal law, but are checking the fundamental consistency of the maxim.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ways to fail:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Contradiction in Conception: We can't image said world, or would never want to live in it.
										This generates perfect duties, stating we can never do that maxim.
									</li>
									<li>
										Contradiction in the Will: We wished ourselves into said world, but our will causes a contradiction.
										We end up finding ourselves wishing that others wouldn't abide by the maxim. 
										This generates imperfect duties, stating we don’t always fail/refuse to do that maxim.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Lies are something that always fail this formulation.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The Formula of Humanity</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								All actions you take have to respect humanity as an end themselves, and not a means
							</li>
							<li>
								This formulation is built on the idea of consent. If you have consent/permission to use someone as a means,
								you may do so.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The Formula of Autonomy</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								I find this best expressed using the example of the "Kingdom of Ends"
								<ul>
									<li>
										Always act such that your maxim acts as if you were legislating a kingdom of ends. 
										This kingdom is bound by a pre-agreed set of laws.
									</li>
									<li>
										Original Position: We are all rational beings, but we are behind a veil of ignorance,
										where we have no idea about who we are, or what we look like. We only now we are rational
									</li>
									<li>
										If said kingdom of ends is acceptable for everyone, the maxim passes this formulation.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					
					<p>
						The formula of humanity is one of the key reasons why Deontology is a strong choice of moral framework for leaders. 
						It helps prevent unethical leaders and profiteers, by ensuring that followers are never used as a means, but
						are always respected as an end, and for who they are.
					</p>
					<p>
						This idea fairly easy to implement in ones daily life. The formula of autonomy is one of the easiest questions to 
						ask ourselves when we make a decision. If I were in the other person's shoes, would I want someone to do this to me?
						If the answer is no, you shouldn't do the thing.
