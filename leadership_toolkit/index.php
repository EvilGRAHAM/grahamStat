						Scarcity
					</h2>

					<p>
						The idea of scarcity, and how it can override one's decision making processes represents a strong tool for any leader. 
						Scarcity can work in a leader’s favour in one of two possible ways. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The first way is by removing scarcity, leaders can remove conflict. Because we value things that are scarce, 
						conflict can arise from this, when multiple people value something. By removing the scarcity around this thing, 
						by allowing people to share it, or creating more of it, conflict can be more easily resolved. Job rotations of preferable work or shifts, 
						creating an open office environment with no offices both rely on this idea, that by removing scarcity in the workplace, 
						leaders can help reduce conflict among followers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second means of using scarcity is by creating it. This increase value in people’s eyes, 
						as we recognize that we might not be able not be able to necessarily attain it. This can then be used to direct follower’s 
						efforts into tasks leaders deem more important. Things such as employee of the month programs, corner offices, promotions and 
						raises all work on this idea. These ideas may be artificially scarce (you could have more than one employee of the month, 
						or give smaller raises out to more people), or physically scarce (most offices only have as many corner offices as they have corners), 
						but the principle still holds.

						Tool 7: Deontology
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
					<p>
						I'm personally a fan of the moral philosophy of Deontology, or as it is better known; Kantianism. Kantian ethics is founded on the
						idea that it is the intent of an action that is important, not the consequence of said action. This leads to the idea of the 
						maxim which states: "In <i>x</i>, I will do <i>y</i>, in order to achieve <i>z</i>." That is, for a given situation <i>x</i>, I will do
						the action <i>y</i>, with the intention of achieving <i>z</i>. Kant states the categorical imperative, the central tenant of this philosophy as,
						"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law" (Kant, 1785). From this Kant created
						3 formulations that a maxim must pass in order to be moral.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Formula of Universality and the Law of Nature</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Take your maxim and apply it to the world so that is functions as a universal law.
							</li>
							<li>
								Everybody when they are in those circumstances does your maxim, and see what happens.
							</li>
							<li>
								We are not checking the consequences of the universal law, but are checking the fundamental consistency of the maxim.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ways to fail:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Contradiction in Conception: We can't image said world, or would never want to live in it.
										This generates perfect duties, stating we can never do that maxim.
									</li>
									<li>
										Contradiction in the Will: We wished ourselves into said world, but our will causes a contradiction.
										We end up finding ourselves wishing that others wouldn't abide by the maxim. 
										This generates imperfect duties, stating we don’t always fail/refuse to do that maxim.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Lies are something that always fail this formulation.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The Formula of Humanity</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								All actions you take have to respect humanity as an end themselves, and not a means
							</li>
							<li>
								This formulation is built on the idea of consent. If you have consent/permission to use someone as a means,
								you may do so.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The Formula of Autonomy</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								I find this best expressed using the example of the "Kingdom of Ends"
								<ul>
									<li>
										Always act such that your maxim acts as if you were legislating a kingdom of ends. 
										This kingdom is bound by a pre-agreed set of laws.
									</li>
									<li>
										Original Position: We are all rational beings, but we are behind a veil of ignorance,
										where we have no idea about who we are, or what we look like. We only now we are rational
									</li>
									<li>
										If said kingdom of ends is acceptable for everyone, the maxim passes this formulation.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul
					</ol>
					<p>
						The formula of humanity is one of the key reasons why Deontology is a strong choice of moral framework for leaders. 
						It helps prevent unethical leaders and profiteers, by ensuring that followers are never used as a means, but
						are always respected as an end, and for who they are.
					</p>
					<p>
						This idea fairly easy to implement in ones daily life. The formula of autonomy is one of the easiest questions to 
						ask ourselves when we make a decision. If I were in the other person's shoes, would I want someone to do this to me?
						If the answer is no, you shouldn't do the thing.
